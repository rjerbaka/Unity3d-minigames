The Unity 3D minigames in this repository were developed for a Virtual Reality course.

## 1 . WreckingBall :

* Update functions (Update – FixedUpdate – LateUpdate)
* Camera Behavior control

## 2 . PlanetBall :

First-player game where player can move around and hold & move objects in the scene.  

### Motivation
PlanetBall was developed in order for me to familiarize with :
* First Person Character control
* Ray casting
* Visual metaphors in Virtual Reality
* Tags & Layers

## 3 . CarCrash :

First-player game where player has to cross the road without getting hit by the cars in the scene.  

### Motivation
CarCrash was developed in order for me to familiarize with :
* NavMesh

* GUI : Graphical User Interface
* Scene changes in games
